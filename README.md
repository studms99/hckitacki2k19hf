# hckitacki2k19hf (now enhanced as 2k22 special edition)

This is my successful repository for the 2k22 challenge.

I will add all the files for my repo one after each other.

This file will be expanded with additional how-to's and installation guides.

At the moment there are no special system requirements.

Despite this you need internet access, unless you are physically at the GH arctic archive atm - of course (where network access is sufficient).
This seems to be the case for ISP-employees, too.
